# Kattis_2048_Game
Based on https://open.kattis.com/problems/2048

This is the famous 2048 game, done using python and OOP. 

It takes in an existing 4x4 board state and a direction 0,1,2,3 (for left, up, right, down) and outputs the correct final board state after making that move.

#To Do:
1. Clean up the code/refactor
2. Create the actual game to play (with random tiles spawning after each move etc)
3. Create a GUI
